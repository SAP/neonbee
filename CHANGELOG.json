        "message" : "refactor: Remove broadcasting from DataRequest/simplify\nLoggerManagerVerticle\n\nSee NeonBee/architecture/#18. In a recent change a \"broadcasting\" option\nwas added to DataRequest and DataVerticle, mainly to publish messages to\nevery listening verticle on the eventbus. The reason this was added was\ndue to a newly introduced \"LoggerManagerVerticle\", a DataVerticle to\nmaintain the levels of loggers. In order to be able to change the log\nlevels of all loggers in a clustered NeonBee instance at once, the\nbroadcasting option could be used to set the log levels to all cluster\nnodes.\n\nThe introduction of the broadcasting option however, caused multiple\nbreaks in the concept of inter DataVerticle communication: With the\nbroadcasting parameter of DataRequest in place any interface methods\nexposed in DataSource and DataSink will, in an undocumented manner, not\nfunction as expected:\n\nFor DataSource any data returned by the called verticle will simply end\nup in void. The called verticle does NOT know about this and thus will\nnot be able to react accordingly. Even worse, even the calling verticle\nhas no information whether and which verticles received the boadcsting\nrequest, thus rendering the full interface useless in my opinion. For\nDataSink similarely, the broadcasting event can not be tracked by the\ncalling verticle and a success / failure cannot be reported by by the\ncalled verticle either.\n\nAs this option is rather limited in use and will cause side-effects\neasily, it was decided in issue #18 to remove the parameter, to maybe be\nreintroduced later with a better concept. This however requried to\nre-implement parts of the mentioned LoggerManagerVerticle:\n\nIt was decided, that instead of using the DataVerticle implementation of\nthe LoggerManagerVerticle to handle the distribution of the logger\nlevel, the LoggerManagerVerticle will be reduced to a pure JSON-based\nDataVerticle which will publish a EventBus message to all cluster nodes\napplying a LoggerConfiguration object.\n\nBefore this change LoggerConfiguration was much like a POJO with three\nvalues: the logger name, a configuration level and an effective level.\nThe effective level however, unlike the name suggests, was not the\neffective level of the underlying logger, but could have been \"null\" or\neven a different value than the \"real\" effective logger value. This was\nconfusing. To overcome this, LoggerConfiguration was changed to\nrepresent only the logger name and a configuration level. The change can\nthen be applied to the logger by calling a new \"applyConfiguredLevel\"\nmethod, which will set the effective level. Also calling the\nset/getEffectiveLevel methods will now really retrieve or set the level\nof the associated logger, instead of just storing another value. This\nagain simplified the LoggerManagerVerticle implementation.\n\nLast, it was decided to remove the LoggerConfigurations class, which was\npreviously used for inter-verticle communcation. Instead of using the\nLoggerConfigurations class a default List / JsonArray was used, which\nshould allow for the LoggerManagerVerticle to be more easily used in an\nupcoming admin UI implementation for NeonBee. This again reduced the\namount of testable code in NeonBee.\n",

In order to be able to change the log\nlevels of all loggers in a clustered NeonBee instance at once, the\nbroadcasting option could be used to set the log levels to all cluster\nnodes.\n\nThe introduction of the broadcasting option however, caused multiple\nbreaks in the concept of inter DataVerticle communication: With the\nbroadcasting parameter of DataRequest in place any interface methods\nexposed in DataSource and DataSink will, in an undocumented manner, not\nfunction as expected:\n\nFor DataSource any data returned by the called verticle will simply end\nup in void.

For\nDataSink similarely, the broadcasting event can not be tracked by the\ncalling verticle and a success / failure cannot be reported by by the\ncalled verticle either.\n\nAs this option is rather limited in use and will cause side-effects\neasily, it was decided in issue #18 to remove the parameter, to maybe be\nreintroduced later with a better concept.
