        "messageBody" : "After a brainstorming session with all contributors, ideas and features which have been previously often discussed and requested, have been collected. A new file structure under docs/roadmap.md and docs/milestones/*.md was introduced explaining future milestones in NeonBee and making future usage scnearios more predictable. Also contributors will more easily find a high level description of the feature added and the milestone structure can be used documenting and addressing further accepted ideas in future. This helps putting them on a timeline so others may account for when to expect these kinds of functionallity.\n\nIn contrast to RFCs the milestone structure is more focused on project management, features, timeline, etc. and not so much on the actual technical implementation details."
