In a recent change a \"broadcasting\" option\nwas added to DataRequest and DataVerticle, mainly to publish messages to\nevery listening verticle on the eventbus. The reason this was added was\ndue to a newly introduced \"LoggerManagerVerticle\", a DataVerticle to\nmaintain the levels of loggers. In order to be able to change the log\nlevels of all loggers in a clustered NeonBee instance at once, the\nbroadcasting option could be used to set the log levels to all cluster\nnodes.\n\nThe introduction of the broadcasting option however, caused multiple\nbreaks in the concept of inter DataVerticle communication: With the\nbroadcasting parameter of DataRequest in place any interface methods\nexposed in DataSource and DataSink will, in an undocumented manner, not\nfunction as expected:\n\nFor DataSource any data returned by the called verticle will simply end\nup in void. The called verticle does NOT know about this and thus will\nnot be able to react accordingly. Even worse, even the calling verticle\nhas no information whether and which verticles received the boadcsting\nrequest, thus rendering the full interface useless in my opinion. For\nDataSink similarely, the broadcasting event can not be tracked by the\ncalling verticle and a success / failure cannot be reported by by the\ncalled verticle either.\n\nAs this option is rather limited in use and will cause side-effects\neasily, it was decided in issue #18 to remove the parameter, to maybe be\nreintroduced later with a better concept. This however requried to\nre-implement parts of the mentioned LoggerManagerVerticle:\n\nIt was decided, that instead of using the DataVerticle implementation of\nthe LoggerManagerVerticle to handle the distribution of the logger\nlevel, the LoggerManagerVerticle will be reduced to a pure JSON-based\nDataVerticle which will publish a EventBus message to all cluster nodes\napplying a LoggerConfiguration object.\n\nBefore this change LoggerConfiguration was much like a POJO with three\nvalues: the logger name, a configuration level and an effective level.\nThe effective level however, unlike the name suggests, was not the\neffective level of the underlying logger, but could have been \"null\" or\neven a different value than the \"real\" effective logger value. This was\nconfusing. To overcome this, LoggerConfiguration was changed to\nrepresent only the logger name and a configuration level. The change can\nthen be applied to the logger by calling a new \"applyConfiguredLevel\"\nmethod, which will set the effective level.

When it comes to a logging facade and backend,\nSLF4J / Logback was chosen by NeonBee. Previously NeonBee had its own\nimplementation for the LoggingFacade, possibly making wrong assumtions\nwhen converting arguments into an array before passing it down to the\nmasqueraded logger.\n\nThis change reduces the logging facade to be making as less as possible\nassumptions and clearly indicating that the underlying logger follows\nthe SLF4J rules, by exposing its interface. The JavaDoc was changed to\nindicate that masquarading the logger will loose its ability to deal\nwith markers, also indicated by a UnsupportedOperationExeption thrown\nwhen anyways trying.\n\nAs with the pre Vert.x 4 implementation the Vert.x logger did in fact\nreorder arguments before forwarding it to the underlying logger\nimplementation, the plain SLF4J logger and LoggingFacade is no longer\nreording arguments. Thus also NeonBee has to follow the SLF4J convention\n[1] of putting the throwable as a last parameter into the format list.\nThis change adapts all calls to any longer.\n\n[1] http://www.slf4j.org/faq.html#paramException",
