## 🚀 Milestone: Other / smaller features & functions
 🌌 Post 1.0 Era

### 📝 Milestone Description

This milestone item collects other / smaller features for the current epic, which the NeonBee committers agreed on implementing, but did not fit into any existing milestone and / or putting them in an own milestone item is not sufficient.

## Tasks / Features

- Add support for web socket based endpoints to NeonBee
- Add support for a resumable file upload API like [TUS](https://tus.io/)
- Add a new "resiliency layer" extending the original [short term caching concept](E1_MS99_others.md)
- Add support for providing different `LoggingFacade` implementations and make them configurable in the NeonBee configuration.
