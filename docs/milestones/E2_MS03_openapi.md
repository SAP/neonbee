## 🚀 Milestone: OpenAPI endpoint, MicroMeter support / metrics
 🌌 Post 1.0 Era

### 📝 Milestone Description

Currently the only endpoint exposing entity-based fully structured and typed interfaces is the OData endpoint which, at the time of writing, uses the Olingo library and exposes a OData V4 interface. With the [configurable & modular endpoints milestone](E1_MS06_configurable_endpoints.md) support for more endpoint types has been added. Another common structured API endpoint standard is the [Swagger OpenAPI standard](https://swagger.io/specification/). This milestone is providing a fully compatible OpenAPI compliant endpoint in addition to the existing OData V4 endpoints to address EntityVerticles in NeonBee.

## Tasks / Features
