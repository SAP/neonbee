This RFC introduces a more robust approach to `EntityVerticle` service discovery and registration within the NeonBee ecosystem, addressing the limitations of the existing system. The proposal aims to improve reliability, scalability, and maintainability by ensuring that services are dynamically discoverable and resilient to change.

## Motivation

This proposal seeks to address problems in our microservices architecture, including `EntityVerticle` registration failures, leading to outages and performance degradation. The primary motivations are:

- **Decoupling Implementation**: By making `EntityVerticle` registration configurable, we enable:
    - Reaction to diverse cluster events, such as Kubernetes events or liveness probes.
    - Centralized `EntityVerticle` registration management.
    - Expedited bug fixes and feature releases.
    - Provision of additional functionalities, such as viewing registered services, manual unregistration, and handling re-registration events.

- **Testability**: Improving testability to ensuring the reliability and stability of the service registry. By abstracting the registration mechanism, we can create isolated test environments. This enables thorough unit and integration testing that simulates various service lifecycle events (e.g., registration, deregistration, error recovery) to verify the behavior of the registry in a controlled environment, ensuring that it meets our robustness and resilience requirements.

- **Service Resilience**: Enhances system robustness by ensuring dependents are not affected by outdated or incorrect registry information.

## Technical Details

To implement this RFC, we propose to:
- Enable loading a `Registry<String>` implementation from the configuration.
- Decouple entityRegistry initialization from the NeonBee constructor.
- Refine the abstraction for `unregisterNode` method in `ClusterEntityRegistry`, which is currently utilized by `UnregisterEntityVerticlesHook`.

- **Event-Driven Mechanism Enhancement**: To further solidify the event-driven architecture, we will introduce a robust event publishing and handling mechanism that efficiently manages service lifecycle events. This includes standardized event formats for registration, deregistration, and health checks, and a resilient event handling system that ensures high availability and fault tolerance of the service registry.

## Performance Considerations

Performance is expected to remain optimal. Key considerations include:
- **Event Bus Load**: To minimize impact, event volume monitoring and alerting mechanisms will be implemented.
- **Registry Performance**: Optimization efforts will focus on ensuring the registry can handle rapid service changes efficiently.

## Impact on Existing Functionalities

This RFC's implementation will necessitate a shift in service registration and discovery processes within the NeonBee ecosystem. It will enhance system resilience and scalability, benefiting existing functionalities without adverse effects.


## Alternatives

### Configuration Management Microservice

This alternative proposes a microservice dedicated to centralized configuration management, offering:
- **Centralized Configuration Storage**: A single source of truth for system configurations.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Real-time configuration updates without service restarts.
- **Versioning and Rollback**: Easy rollback to previous configurations if necessary.
- **Event-Driven Updates**: Real-time configuration updates via event subscriptions.

This approach, combined with the proposed Event-Driven Service Registry, would greatly enhance the system's adaptability and management efficiency, aligning with modern microservices best practices.
